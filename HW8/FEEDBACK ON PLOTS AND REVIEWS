very thoughtful reviews of the plots 10/10



NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================


the 3d obstructs the structure, but the structure is symmetric so this is justified

the color is redundant with the z axis, but it helos read the y value in the 3D structure

the z axis label is ambiguous: spell the function out

the axis labels are too small to be readable




NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================

=========

very nice plot that summarize a lot of details at once

labels in the legend top left too small to read

nice unobtrusive labels showing single events

drop rides from the labels on the right for compactness


consider a more compact notation for the y axis: e.g. use units of 1000 rides

==========

unmotivated empty space to the right

the choice of red single color is "aggressive" to the sight, which may or may not be the desired effect given context. but it is a color that does not comply well with color blindness, so if that is the desired effect it would be lost in 10% of the male population

axis labels a bit small

Ortrune
=======

thick lines are not neessary and cause ambiguity when thy overlab

the datapoints are sparse: the plot could be compressed on the x axisand this would aid comparison

tick labels are ont he small side, but not terribly small 

color blindeness compliant

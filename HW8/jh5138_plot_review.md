### jh5138 - plot review

![Alt text](https://github.com/Jihenghuang/PUI2015_Jhuang/blob/master/HW8_plot/99_1_Lane4_6Saturday_SF.jpg "HW8 Plot")

##### Clarity
+ A bit unclear to me what each dot represents, but with [the description](https://github.com/Jihenghuang/PUI2015_Jhuang/blob/master/HW8_plot/README.md) it looks like each dot represents a given hour on a given saturday between Nov 1, 2014 - Oct 31, 2015. Is that right?
+ Axes are also a bit unclear to me: is it that y-axis is **average** speed and x-axis is **total** flow?

##### Esthetic
Clean and clear - but some of the dots not clustered with the others make me wonder what's different about them, eg anything to add which would suggest similarities between higher speed dots that have lower flow?

##### Honesty
Looks good - I do not see anything that would skew data or make it a "dishonest" plot

##### Suggestions
+ clarify what dots are in the title (or legend?) - eg maybe title could be "Speed-Flow plot by hour on Saturdays, Nov 1, 2014 - Oct 31, 2015"
+ have axes be more complete what they are measuring (ie average/total mentioned in 'clarity' section above)
+ maybe add a categorical variable as a color if available? eg time of day bucket, month, or similar

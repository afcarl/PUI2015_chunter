### otrune - plot review

![alt text](./ortrune_literacy.png)


##### Clarity
Very clear and easy to read over all. 
Two minor points:
1. y-axis: lowest point at 60% so at very brief glance literacy rate looked to be close to 0 for the lower three regions
2. At first I assumed the entire world was included so got caught slightly off-guard when I didn't see Europe / North America

##### Esthetic
Very clear and straightforward choices - also like that countries are in order in the legend based on their most recent year's literacy rates.

##### Honesty
Aside from y-axis mentioned in clarity, looks to very clearly/objectively represent data

##### Suggestions
+ start y-label at 0, then add a break point jumping axis from 0 up to 50 to maximize plot space dedicated to real data rather than have bottom half of plot empty
+ include in title that not looking at all regions, for example maybe something like "Literacy by region over time (Asia and Africa )"
+ *maybe* make lines slightly thinner so easier to see difference in East Asia and Latin America from 1995-2005

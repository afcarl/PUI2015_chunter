### assignment 1
in this assignment I am drawing between 10 and 2000 random numbers 100 times from 6 different distributions, then plotting them a) as a scatter of mean vs size and b) as a histogram of the means

Including the "fbb_matplotlibrc.json" file the "Assignment1" notebook can be run top to bottom, or the below two lines can be commented out to run just the notebook without the "fbb_matplotlibrc.json" file:
- s = json.load(open("fbb_matplotlibrc.json"))
- pl.rcParams.update(s)

### CitiBike HW

### Question
Are CitiBike's easing commuter journey's across the East River?

### Hypothesis
+ H0: The share of CitiBike subscribers crossing the East River during peak commuting hours (as defined by the MTA) is not significantly different at 95% confidence level than the share of CitiBike subscribers not crossing the river during peak hours.
+ H1: Not H0.

### Project work balance
#### hypothesis generation
Max, Arno, Clayton discussed and equally shared hypothesis generation.
Max had the original idea of looking at bridges as he is an avid CitiBike user

#### Data cleaning
1. Clayton is tagging trips as cross east river or not
2. Max is defining historic hours as "on peak" or "not on peak"

#### Analysis
